             <p>

               I was about 6 years old when I first began painting. I used to spoil all of my mothers paints and fill the empty bottles with water. This was my usual past time when my parents went out or by any chance I was alone at home. I painted the carpets, curtains and my school books. Finally my mom decided to put into a painting class and that’s when my journey began.<br>

               I was fast in learning the techniques and finished the course in 1 month which usually took a month and a half. In this class I began with acrylic paints and soon after I was done with this course I bought a few cheap oil paints. I was always attracted towards oil colors.<br>

               Later I decided to join an oil painting class. I went for about 2 weeks and stopped. I realized I was more of a self-learner than a student of another teacher. I learnt best through the old fashioned trial and error method because it taught me so many things I didn’t even know I wanted to learn.<br>

               The teacher focused on a picture whereas I wanted to experiment with different techniques and textures. Even if they looked bizarre sometimes, they gave me the excitement to paint.That’s how my journey truly began!
